Aim of the project: Parsing .csv files; finding their underlying statistics

Tools used: Flask, Flask Restful, Pandas, JSON library

Programme's setup and workings: The programme is fairly simple to use; Having started the .py file one needs to pass the path to their .csv file twice (in the terminal). An URL link should which, when clicked, should open the browser. The default address (http://127.0.0.1:5000) then has to be ended with any of the endpoints (as defined in the .py file) or an integer standing for the ID of a specific object from the .csv file.
